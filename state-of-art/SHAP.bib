	abstract = {Objective: We aimed to develop a 5-year overall survival prediction model for patients with oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma based on machine learning methods. Subjects and methods: The data were obtained from electronic medical records of 224 OTSCC patients at the PLA General Hospital. A five-year overall survival prediction model was constructed using logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. Model performance was evaluated according to the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. The output of the optimal model was explained using the Python package (SHapley Additive exPlanations, SHAP). Results: After passing through the grid search and secondary modeling, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine was the best prediction model (AUC = 0.860). As explained by SHapley Additive exPlanations, N-stage, age, systemic inflammation response index, positive lymph nodes, plasma fibrinogen, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, and T-stage could perform a 5-year overall survival prediction for OTSCC. The 5-year survival rate was 42%. Conclusion: The Light Gradient Boosting Machine prediction model predicted 5-year overall survival in OTSCC patients, and this predictive tool has potential prognostic implications for patients with OTSCC. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Rheport is an online rheumatology referral system allowing automatic appointment triaging of new rheumatology patient referrals according to the respective probability of an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD). Previous research reported that Rheport was well accepted among IRD patients. Its accuracy was, however, limited, currently being based on an expert-based weighted sum score. This study aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) models could improve this limited accuracy. Materials and methods: Data from a national rheumatology registry (RHADAR) was used to train and test nine different ML models to correctly classify IRD patients. Diagnostic performance was compared of ML models and the current algorithm was compared using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Feature importance was investigated using shapley additive explanation (SHAP). Results: A complete data set of 2265 patients was used to train and test ML models. 30.5% of patients were diagnosed with an IRD, 69.3% were female. The diagnostic accuracy of the current Rheport algorithm (AUROC of 0.534) could be improved with all ML models, (AUROC ranging between 0.630 and 0.737). Targeting a sensitivity of 90%, the logistic regression model could double current specificity (17% vs. 33%). Finger joint pain, inflammatory marker levels, psoriasis, symptom duration and female sex were the five most important features of the best performing logistic regression model for IRD classification. Conclusion: In summary, ML could improve the accuracy of a currently used rheumatology online referral system. Including further laboratory parameters and enabling individual feature importance adaption could increase accuracy and lead to broader usage.

	abstract = {In the field of landscape epidemiology, the contribution of machine learning (ML) to modeling of epidemiological risk scenarios presents itself as a good alternative. This study aims to break with the ”black box” paradigm that underlies the application of automatic learning techniques by using SHAP to determine the contribution of each variable in ML models applied to geospatial health, using the prevalence of hookworms, intestinal parasites, in Ethiopia, where they are widely distributed; the country bears the third-highest burden of hookworm in Sub-Saharan Africa. XGBoost software was used, a very popular ML model, to fit and analyze the data. The Python SHAP library was used to understand the importance in the trained model, of the variables for predictions. The description of the contribution of these variables on a particular prediction was obtained, using different types of plot methods. The results show that the ML models are superior to the classical statistical models; not only demonstrating similar results but also explaining, by using the SHAP package, the influence and interactions between the variables in the generated models. This analysis provides information to help understand the epidemiological problem presented and provides a tool for similar studies. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Recent developments in research on artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine deal with the analysis of image data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to support the of decision-making of medical personnel. For this purpose, machine learning (ML) algorithms are often used, which do not explain the internal decision-making process at all. Thus, it is often difficult to validate or interpret the results of the applied AI methods. This manuscript aims to overcome this problem by using methods of explainable AI (XAI) to interpret the decision-making of an ML algorithm in the use case of predicting the survival rate of patients with brain tumors based on MRI scans. Therefore, we explore the analysis of brain images together with survival data to predict survival in gliomas with a focus on improving the interpretability of the results. Using the Brain Tumor Segmentation dataset BraTS 2020, we used a well-validated dataset for evaluation and relied on a convolutional neural network structure to improve the explainability of important features by adding Shapley overlays. The trained network models were used to evaluate SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) directly and were not optimized for accuracy. The resulting overfitting of some network structures is therefore seen as a use case of the presented interpretation method. It is shown that the network structure can be validated by experts using visualizations, thus making the decision-making of the method interpretable. Our study highlights the feasibility of combining explainers with 3D voxels and also the fact that the interpretation of prediction results significantly supports the evaluation of results. The implementation in python is available on gitlab as “XAIforBrainImgSurv”. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Linking genotypic changes to phenotypic traits based on machine learning methods has various challenges. In this study, we developed a workflow based on bioinformatics and machine learning methods using transcriptomic data for sepsis obtained at the first clinical presentation for predicting the risk of sepsis. By combining bioinformatics with machine learning methods, we have attempted to overcome current challenges in predicting disease risk using transcriptomic data. Methods: High-throughput sequencing transcriptomic data processing and gene annotation were performed using R software. Machine learning models were constructed, and model performance was evaluated by machine learning methods in Python. The models were visualized and interpreted using the Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP) method. Results: Based on the preset parameters and using recursive feature elimination implemented via machine learning, the top 10 optimal genes were screened for the establishment of the machine learning models. In a comparison of model performance, CatBoost was selected as the optimal model. We explored the significance of each gene in the model and the interaction between each gene through SHAP analysis. Conclusion: The combination of CatBoost and SHAP may serve as the best-performing machine learning model for predicting transcriptomic and sepsis risks. The workflow outlined may provide a new approach and direction in exploring the mechanisms associated with genes and sepsis risk.

The goal is to assist in finding suitable libraries that support visual explainability and interpretability of the output of their AI model. Especially in sensitive application areas, such as medicine, this is crucial for understanding the decision-making process and for a safe application. Therefore, we use a glioma classification model’s reasoning as an underlying case. We present a comparison of 11 identified Python libraries that provide an addition to the better known SHAP and LIME libraries for visualizing explainability. The libraries are selected based on certain attributes, such as being implemented in Python, supporting visual analysis, thorough documentation, and active maintenance. We showcase and compare four libraries for global interpretations (ELI5, Dalex, InterpretML, and SHAP) and three libraries for local interpretations (Lime, Dalex, and InterpretML). As use case, we process a combination of openly available data sets on glioma for the task of studying feature importance when classifying the grade II, III, and IV brain tumor subtypes glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AASTR), and oligodendroglioma (ODG), out of 1276 samples and 252 attributes. The exemplified model confirms known variations and studying local explainability contributes to revealing less known variations as putative biomarkers.

	abstract = {PURPOSE Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values represent a unified approach to interpreting predictions made by complex machine learning (ML) models, with superior consistency and accuracy compared with prior methods. We describe a novel application of SHAP values to the prediction of mortality risk in prostate cancer. METHODS Patients with nonmetastatic, node-negative prostate cancer, diagnosed between 2004 and 2015, were identified using the National Cancer Database. Model features were specified a priori: age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, percent positive cores (PPC), comorbidity score, and clinical T stage. We trained a gradient-boosted tree model and applied SHAP values to model predictions. Open-source libraries in Python 3.7 were used for all analyses. RESULTS We identified 372,808 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. When analyzing the interaction between PSA and Gleason score, we demonstrated consistency with the literature using the example of low-PSA, high-Gleason prostate cancer, recently identified as a unique entity with a poor prognosis. When analyzing the PPC-Gleason score interaction, we identified a novel finding of stronger interaction effects in patients with Gleason ≥ 8 disease compared with Gleason 6-7 disease, particularly with PPC ≥ 50%. Subsequent confirmatory linear analyses supported this finding: 5-year overall survival in Gleason ≥ 8 patients was 87.7% with PPC, 50% versus 77.2% with PPC ≥ 50% (P, .001), compared with 89.1% versus 86.0% in Gleason 7 patients (P, .001), with a significant interaction term between PPC ≥ 50% and Gleason ≥ 8 (P, .001). CONCLUSION We describe a novel application of SHAP values for modeling and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects in prostate cancer. This ML-based approach is a promising technique with the potential to meaningfully improve risk stratification and staging systems. © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in women. Although survival rates have improved, unmet psychosocial needs remain challenging because the quality of life (QoL) and QoL-related factors change over time. In addition, traditional statistical models have limitations in identifying factors associated with QoL over time, particularly concerning the physical, psychological, economic, spiritual, and social dimensions. Objective: This study aimed to identify patient-centered factors associated with QoL among patients with breast cancer using a machine learning (ML) algorithm to analyze data collected along different survivorship trajectories. Methods: The study used 2 data sets. The first data set was the cross-sectional survey data from the Breast Cancer Information Grand Round for Survivorship (BIG-S) study, which recruited consecutive breast cancer survivors who visited the outpatient breast cancer clinic at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between 2018 and 2019. The second data set was the longitudinal cohort data from the Beauty Education for Distressed Breast Cancer (BEST) cohort study, which was conducted at 2 university-based cancer hospitals in Seoul, Korea, between 2011 and 2016. QoL was measured using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire Core 30 questionnaire. Feature importance was interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The final model was selected based on the highest mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The analyses were performed using the Python 3.7 programming environment (Python Software Foundation). Results: The study included 6265 breast cancer survivors in the training data set and 432 patients in the validation set. The mean age was 50.6 (SD 8.66) years and 46.8% (n=2004) had stage 1 cancer. In the training data set, 48.3% (n=3026) of survivors had poor QoL. The study developed ML models for QoL prediction based on 6 algorithms. Performance was good for all survival trajectories: overall (AUC 0.823), baseline (AUC 0.835), within 1 year (AUC 0.860), between 2 and 3 years (AUC 0.808), between 3 and 4 years (AUC 0.820), and between 4 and 5 years (AUC 0.826). Emotional and physical functions were the most important features before surgery and within 1 year after surgery, respectively. Fatigue was the most important feature between 1 and 4 years. Despite the survival period, hopefulness was the most influential feature on QoL. External validation of the models showed good performance with AUCs between 0.770 and 0.862. Conclusions: The study identified important factors associated with QoL among breast cancer survivors across different survival trajectories. Understanding the changing trends of these factors could help to intervene more precisely and timely, and potentially prevent or alleviate QoL-related issues for patients. The good performance of our ML models in both training and external validation sets suggests the potential use of this approach in identifying patient-centered factors and improving survivorship care. © 2023 JMIR Public Health and Surveillance.},

We collected data from PCR laboratory tests for confirming pertussis or RSV infection, clinical symptoms, and routine blood testing results, which were used for the algorithm development. We used a LightGBM model to develop 2 sets of models for predicting pertussis and RSV infection: for each type of infection, we developed one model trained with the combination of clinical symptoms and results from routine blood test (white blood cell count, lymphocyte fraction and C-reactive protein), and one with symptoms only. All analyses were performed using Python 3.7.4 with Shapley values (Shap values) visualization package for predictor visualization. The performance of the models was assessed through confusion matrices. The models were developed on a dataset of 599 children. The recall for the pertussis model combining symptoms and routine laboratory tests was 0.72, and 0.74 with clinical symptoms only. For RSV infection, recall was 0.68 with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests and 0.71 with clinical symptoms only. The F1 score for the pertussis model was 0.72 in both models, and, for RSV infection, it was 0.69 and 0.75. ML models can support the diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases such as pertussis or RSV infection in children based on common symptoms and laboratory tests. ML-based clinical decision support systems may be developed in the future in large networks to create accurate tools for clinical support and public health surveillance. 2023 Mc Cord—De Iaco, Gesualdo, Pandolfi, Croci and Tozzi.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have proposed that heat shock proteins 27 (HSP27) and its anti-HSP27 antibody titers may play a crucial role in several diseases including cardiovascular disease. However, available studies has been used simple analytical methods. This study aimed to determine the factors that associate serum anti-HSP27 antibody titers using ensemble machine learning methods and to demonstrate the magnitude and direction of the predictors using PFI and SHAP methods. The study employed Python 3 to apply various machine learning models, including LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, AdaBoost, SVR, MLP, and MLR. The best models were selected using model evaluation metrics during the K-Fold cross-validation strategy. The LightGBM model (with RMSE: 0.1900 ± 0.0124; MAE: 0.1471 ± 0.0044; MAPE: 0.8027 ± 0.064 as the mean ± sd) and the SHAP method revealed that several factors, including pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB), physical activity level (PAL), platelet distribution width, mid-upper arm circumference, systolic blood pressure, age, red cell distribution width, waist-to-hip ratio, neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio, platelet count, serum glucose, serum cholesterol, red blood cells were associated with anti-HSP27, respectively. The study found that PAB and PAL were strongly associated with serum anti-HSP27 antibody titers, indicating a direct and indirect relationship, respectively. These findings can help improve our understanding of the factors that determine anti-HSP27 antibody titers and their potential role in disease development. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {The main objective of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is to provide effective explanations for black-box classifiers. The existing literature lists many desirable properties for explanations to be useful, but there is a scarce consensus on how to quantitatively evaluate explanations in practice. Moreover, explanations are typically used only to inspect black-box models, and the proactive use of explanations as a decision support is generally overlooked. Among the many approaches to XAI, a widely adopted paradigm is Local Linear Explanations—with LIME and SHAP emerging as state-of-the-art methods. We show that these methods are plagued by many defects including unstable explanations, divergence of actual implementations from the promised theoretical properties, and explanations for the wrong label. This highlights the need to have standard and unbiased evaluation procedures for Local Linear Explanations in the XAI field. In this paper we address the problem of identifying a clear and unambiguous set of metrics for the evaluation of Local Linear Explanations. This set includes both existing and novel metrics defined specifically for this class of explanations. All metrics have been included in an open Python framework, named LEAF. The purpose of LEAF is to provide a reference for end users to evaluate explanations in a standardised and unbiased way, and to guide researchers towards developing improved explainable techniques. © 2021 Amparore et al.

	abstract = {Purpose: To explore whether texture features based on magnetic resonance can distinguish diseases combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before operation. Methods: The clinical baseline data and MRI information of 342 patients with pathologically diagnosed cHCC-CC and HCC in two medical centers were collected. The data were divided into the training set and the test set at a ratio of 7:3. MRI images of tumors were segmented with ITK-SNAP software, and python open-source platform was used for texture analysis. Logistic regression as the base model, mutual information (MI) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were used to select the most favorable features. The clinical, radiomics, and clinic-radiomics model were constructed based on logistic regression. The model’s effectiveness was comprehensively evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and Youden index which is the main, and the model results were exported by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results: A total of 23 features were included. Among all models, the arterial phase-based clinic-radiomics model showed the best performance in differentiating cHCC-CC from HCC before an operation, with the AUC of the test set being 0.863 (95% CI: 0.782 to 0.923), the specificity and sensitivity being 0.918 (95% CI: 0.819 to 0.973) and 0.738 (95% CI: 0.580 to 0.861), respectively. SHAP value results showed that the RMS was the most important feature affecting the model. Conclusion: Clinic-radiomics model based on DCE-MRI may be useful to distinguish cHCC-CC from HCC in a preoperative setting, especially in the arterial phase, and RMS has the greatest impact. © 2023 Guo et al.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic necrosis is a consistent prognostic factor in acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the clinical scores currently in use are either too complicated or require data that are unavailable on admission or lack sufficient predictive value. We therefore aimed to develop a tool to aid in necrosis prediction. The XGBoost machine learning algorithm processed data from 2387 patients with AP. The confidence of the model was estimated by a bootstrapping method and interpreted via the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the prediction scores. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to quantify the contribution of each variable provided. Finally, the model was implemented as an online application using the Streamlit Python-based framework. The XGBoost classifier provided an AUC value of 0.757. Glucose, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, gender and total white blood cell count have the most impact on prediction based on the SHAP values. The relationship between the size of the training dataset and model performance shows that prediction performance can be improved. This study combines necrosis prediction and artificial intelligence. The predictive potential of this model is comparable to the current clinical scoring systems and has several advantages over them. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose. PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (P/F) is used to assess the degree of hypoxemia adjusted for oxygen requirements. The Berlin definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) includes P/F as a diagnostic criterion. P/F is invasive and cost-prohibitive for resource-limited settings. SaO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio has the advantages of being easy to calculate, noninvasive, continuous, cost-effective, and reliable, as well as lower infection exposure potential for staff, and avoids iatrogenic anemia. Previous work suggests that the SaO2/FiO2 ratio (S/F) correlates with P/F and can be used as a surrogate in ARDS. Quantitative correlation between S/F and P/F has been verified, but the data for the relative predictive ability for ICU mortality remains in question. We hypothesize that S/F is noninferior to P/F as a predictive feature for ICU mortality. Using a machine-learning approach, we hope to demonstrate the relative mortality predictive capacities of S/F and P/F. Methods. We extracted data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The features age, gender, SaO2, PaO2, FIO2, admission diagnosis, Apache IV, mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU mortality were extracted. Mortality was the dependent variable for our prediction models. Exploratory data analysis was performed in Python. Missing data was imputed with Sklearn Iterative Imputer. Random assignment of all the encounters, 80% to the training (n = 26690) and 20% to testing (n = 6741), was stratified by positive and negative classes to ensure a balanced distribution. We scaled the data using the Sklearn Standard Scaler. Categorical values were encoded using Target Encoding. We used a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm variant called XGBoost as our model. Model hyperparameters were tuned using the Sklearn RandomizedSearchCV with tenfold cross-validation. We used AUC as our metric for model performance. Feature importance was assessed using SHAP, ELI5 (permutation importance), and a built-in XGBoost feature importance method. We constructed partial dependence plots to illustrate the relationship between mortality probability and S/F values. Results. The XGBoost hyperparameter optimized model had an AUC score of.85 on the test set. The hyperparameters selected to train the final models were as follows: colsample_bytree of 0.8, gamma of 1, max_depth of 3, subsample of 1, min_child_weight of 10, and scale_pos_weight of 3. The SHAP, ELI5, and XGBoost feature importance analysis demonstrates that the S/F ratio ranks as the strongest predictor for mortality amongst the physiologic variables. The partial dependence plots illustrate that mortality rises significantly above S/F values of 200. Conclusion. S/F was a stronger predictor of mortality than P/F based upon feature importance evaluation of our data. Our study is hypothesis-generating and a prospective evaluation is warranted. Take-Home Points. S/F ratio is a noninvasive continuous method of measuring hypoxemia as compared to P/F ratio. Our study shows that the S/F ratio is a better predictor of mortality than the more widely used P/F ratio to monitor and manage hypoxemia. © 2021 Sharad Patel et al.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has quickly risen since the beginning of 2020 to become a global pandemic. As a result of the rapid growth of COVID-19, hospitals are tasked with managing an increasing volume of these cases with neither a known effective therapy, an existing vaccine, nor well-established guidelines for clinical management. The need for actionable knowledge amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is dire and yet, given the urgency of this illness and the speed with which the healthcare workforce must devise useful policies for its management, there is insufficient time to await the conclusions of detailed, controlled, prospective clinical research. Thus, we present a retrospective study evaluating laboratory data and mortality from patients with positive RT-PCR assay results for SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study is to identify prognostic serum biomarkers in patients at greatest risk of mortality. To this end, we develop a machine learning model using five serum chemistry laboratory parameters (c-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, serum calcium, serum albumin, and lactic acid) from 398 patients (43 expired and 355 non-expired) for the prediction of death up to 48 h prior to patient expiration. The resulting support vector machine model achieved 91% sensitivity and 91% specificity (AUC 0.93) for predicting patient expiration status on held-out testing data. Finally, we examine the impact of each feature and feature combination in light of different model predictions, highlighting important patterns of laboratory values that impact outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.},

	abstract = {3D printing is an effective method to prepare 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. However, optimization of printing conditions to obtain suitable mechanical properties for various tissue engineering applications is costly and time consuming. To address this problem, in this study, scikit-learn Python machine learning library was used to apply four machine learning-based approaches which are ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, random forest (RF), light gradient Boost (LGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and artificial neural network models to understand the relationship between 3D printing parameters and tensile strength of poly(lactic acid) (PLA). 68 combinations of process parameters for nozzle temperature, printing speed, layer height and tensile strength were used from investigated research papers. Then, datasets were divided as training (80%) and test (20%). After building the OLS linear regression, RF, LGBM, XGB and artificial neural network models, the correlation heatmap and feature importance of each printing parameter for tensile strength values were determined, respectively. Then, the tensile strength was predicted for real datasets to evaluate the performance of the models. The results demonstrate that XGB model was the most successful in predicting tensile strength among the studied models with an R 2 value of 0.98 and 0.94 for train and test values, respectively. A close R 2 value for the train and test also indicated that there was no overfitting of the data to the model. Finally, SHAP analysis shows significance of each feature on prediction of tensile strength. This study can be extended for independent variables including nozzle pressure, strut size and molecular weight of PLA and dependent variables such as elongation and elastic modulus of PLA which may be a powerful tool to predict the mechanical properties of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. © 2023 © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a major complication that results in short- and long-term mortality among patients. Here, we adopted machine learning algorithms to build prediction models with the overarching goal of identifying patients who are at a high risk of such unfavorable kidney outcomes. Methods: A total of 1686 patients (development cohort) and 422 patients (validation cohort), with 126 pre- and intra-operative variables, were recruited from the First Medical Centre and the Sixth Medical Centre of Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, respectively. Analyses were performed using six machine learning techniques, namely K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and neural network, and the APPROACH score, a previously established risk score for CSA-AKI. For model tuning, optimal hyperparameter was achieved by using GridSearch with 5-fold cross-validation from the scikit-learn library. Model performance was externally assessed via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Explainable machine learning was performed using the Python SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) package and Seaborn library, which allow the calculation of marginal contributory SHAP value. Results: 637 patients (30.2%) developed CSA-AKI within seven days after surgery. In the external validation, the RF classifier exhibited the best performance among the six machine learning techniques, as shown by the ROC curve and DCA, while the traditional APPROACH risk score showed a relatively poor performance. Further analysis found no specific causative factor contributing to the development of CSA-AKI; rather, the development of CSA-AKI appeared to be a complex process resulting from a complex interplay of multiple risk factors. The SHAP summary plot illustrated the positive or negative contribution of RF-top 20 variables and extrapolated risk of developing CSA-AKI at individual levels. The Seaborn library showed the effect of each single feature on the model output of the RF prediction. Conclusions: Efficient machine learning approaches were successfully established to predict patients with a high probability of developing acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. These findings are expected to help clinicians to optimize treatment strategies and minimize postoperative complications.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new explainability formalism designed to shed light on how each input variable of a test set impacts the predictions of machine learning models. Hence, we propose a group explainability formalism for trained machine learning decision rules, based on their response to the variability of the input variables distribution. In order to emphasize the impact of each input variable, this formalism uses an information theory framework that quantifies the influence of all input–output observations based on entropic projections. This is thus the first unified and model agnostic formalism enabling data scientists to interpret the dependence between the input variables, their impact on the prediction errors and their influence on the output predictions. Convergence rates of the entropic projections are provided in the large sample case. Most importantly, we prove that computing an explanation in our framework has a low algorithmic complexity, making it scalable to real-life large datasets. We illustrate our strategy by explaining complex decision rules learned using XGBoost, Random Forest or Deep Neural Network classifiers on various datasets such as Adult Income, MNIST, CelebA, Boston Housing, Iris, as well as synthetic ones. We finally make clear its differences with the explainability strategies LIME and SHAP, which are based on single observations.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been applied to solve various remote sensing problems. To fully leverage the power of AI and ML to tackle impactful remote sensing problems, it is essential to enable researchers and practitioners to understand how AI and ML models actually work and thus to improve the model performance strategically. Accurate and timely land cover maps are essential components for informed land management decision making. To address the ever-increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution maps, this paper developed an interactive and open-source online tool, in Python, to help interpret and improve the ML models used for land cover mapping with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool integrates the workflow of both land cover classification and land cover change dynamics, which requires the generation of a time series of land cover maps. Three feature importance metrics are reported, including impurity-based, permutation-based, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) value-based feature importance. Two case studies are presented to showcase the tool’s capability and ease of use, enabling a globally accessible and free convergent application of remote sensing technologies. This tool may inspire researchers to facilitate explainable AI (XAI)-empowered remote sensing applications with GEE. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A multitask deep neural network model was trained on more than 218k different glass compositions. This model, called GlassNet, can predict 85 different properties (such as optical, electrical, dielectric, mechanical, and thermal properties, as well as density, viscosity/relaxation, crystallization, surface tension, and liquidus temperature) of glasses and glass-forming liquids of different chemistries (such as oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and others). The model and the data used to train it are available in the GlassPy Python module as free and open source software for the community to use and build upon. As a proof of concept, GlassNet was used with the MYEGA viscosity equation to predict the temperature dependence of viscosity and outperformed another general purpose viscosity model available in the literature (ViscNet) on unseen data. An explainable AI algorithm (SHAP) was used to extract knowledge correlating the input (physicochemical information) and output (glass properties) of the model, providing valuable insights for glass manufacturing and design. It is hoped that GlassNet, with its free and open source nature, can be used to enable faster and better computer-aided design of new technological glasses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},
